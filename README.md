# libpointlocation
Point location for fully-dynamic line segments in the plane R^2 and great circle segments on the sphere S^2

* DynTSD<Point_Type, Order_Type> class provides an implementation of the fully-dynamic Trapezoidal Search Dag based on the orientation predicates of Point_Type and the randomness strategy Order_Type
* Point_R2
* Point_S2 
* Order_Simple
* Order_Treap
